=> WhatsApp Clone – Push Notification App (React Native)

-> Firebase Push Notifications Setup ✅
- Firebase project created
- App package: `com.whatsappclone`
- google-services.json added correctly inside `android/app/`
- Firebase Messaging services declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Background & Foreground Notification handlers configured

=> Issue Encountered ❌
The build failed on Windows due to path length limit (`CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX = 250`), despite moving to a short directory (`C:\RNApps`).

=> Proof of Completion 📸
- Included screenshots and a screen-recording showing:
  - Firebase setup
  - Code files (`App.tsx`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, etc.)
  - Project structure in VS Code
  - Terminal with exact error
